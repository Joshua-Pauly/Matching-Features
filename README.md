# Matching-Features

This project uses Harris, SURF, and ORB algorithms to detect features from two different images of Penn State Campus.

For HARRIS the algorithm only picked up on 3 matched points.

SURF picked up on the most match points but had errors in matching them.

ORB Had more match points then Haris, but had no errors unlike SURF.
